# GTA-III-Vehicle-Import-Export-Tracker
A python program that tracks and lists vehicles that have not been exported yet.

Known Issues:
Crashes on launch if GTA III is not open
Will stop working properly upon loading a savefile with a different set of delivered vehicles (starting a new game does work properly though)
